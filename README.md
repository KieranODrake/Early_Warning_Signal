# Phylogenomic early warning signals for SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves
The aim is to generate early warning signals (EWS) for epidemic waves of COVID-19 in the UK by deriving leading indicators from phylogenomic analysis.

The Transmission Fitness Polymorphism (TFP) Scanner (https://github.com/mrc-ide/tfpscanner) was used to compute relative cluster growth rates and molecular clock outliers. Simple statistics were derived from these data and assessed as potential leading indicators, based on true positive EWS lead time and the number of false positive EWS.

A similar method for generating EWS was also applied to other non-phylogenomic leading indicators: PCR Ct values, test positivity rate, Google mobility, CoMix survey, and time-shifted hospitalisation data.
